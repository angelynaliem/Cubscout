        <h1>Why Scouting?</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="why">
        <h3>
          For more than 100 years, Scouting programs have instilled in youth the
          values found in the Scout Oath and Scout Law. Today, these values are
          just as relevant in helping youth grow to their full potential as they
          were in 1910. Scouting helps youth develop academic skills,
          self-confidence, ethics, leadership skills, and citizenship skills
          that influence their adult lives. The Boy Scouts of America provides
          youth with programs and activities that allow them to:

          <br /><br />- Try new things <br />- Provide service to others <br />-
          Build self-confidence <br />- Reinforce ethical standards

          <br /><br />While various activities and youth groups teach basic
          skills and promote teamwork, Scouting goes beyond that and encourages
          youth to achieve a deeper appreciation for service to others in their
          community.

          <br /><br />Scouting provides youth with a sense that they are
          important as individuals. It is communicated to them that those in the
          Scouting family care about what happens to them, regardless of whether
          a game is won or lost.

          <br /><br />Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Scouting promotes
          activities that lead to personal responsibility and high self-esteem.
          As a result, when hard decisions have to be made, peer pressure can be
          resisted and the right choices can be made.

          <br /><br />Since 1910, Scouting has helped mold the future leaders of
          this country by combining educational activities and lifelong values
          with fun. The Boy Scouts of America believes and, through more than a
          century of experience, understands that helping youth puts us on a
          path toward a more conscientious, responsible, and productive society.

          <br /><br />Scouting, with programs for young men and women, helps
          meet these six essential needs of the young people growing up in our
          society:
        </h3>
      </div>
      <section class="why">
        <h2>1. Mentoring</h2>
        <p>
          Young people need mentors. Positive relationships with
          adults—community and religious leaders and, of course, parents—provide
          youth with good role models and have a powerful impact on their lives.
          Young people of every age can benefit from constructive, one-on-one
          interaction with adults beyond their own families. Scouting provides
          such adult interaction. We have a process that screens, selects, and
          trains the leaders who can provide that extra attention all young
          people need to succeed in life.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="why">
        <h2>2. Lifelong Learning</h2>
        <p>
          People need to learn all through their lives. We live in a society
          that rewards continual acquisition of skills and knowledge. Scouting
          provides structured settings where young people can learn new skills
          and develop habits of continual learning that will help them succeed.
          From its foundation, Scouting has offered a concrete program of
          discovering, sharing, and applying knowledge and skills.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="why">
        <h2>3. Faith Traditions</h2>
        <p>
          Young people need faith. There is abundant evidence that children
          benefit from the moral compass provided by religious tradition. We
          acknowledge that faith can become an important part of a child’s
          identity. Each of the major faiths breeds hope, optimism, compassion,
          and a belief in a better tomorrow. Scouting encourages each young
          person to begin a spiritual journey through the practice of his or her
          faith tradition. One of the key tenets of Scouting is “duty to God.”
          While Scouting does not define religious belief for its members, it
          has been adopted by and works with youth programs of all major faiths.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="why">
        <h2>4. Serving Others</h2>
        <p>
          Young people need to serve. The level of community service is a good
          indication of the health of any society. Scouting has, from its
          inception, been deeply rooted in the concept of doing for others. “Do
          a Good Turn Daily” is a core Scouting precept. Scouting encourages
          young people to recognize the needs of others and take action
          accordingly. Scouting works through neighborhoods, volunteer
          organizations, and faith-based organizations to help young people
          appreciate and respond to the needs of others.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="why">
        <h2>5. Healthy Living</h2>
        <p>
          Young people need to be well. To get the most from life, one must be
          both mentally and physically fit. A commitment to physical wellness
          has been reflected in Scouting’s outdoor programs such as hiking,
          camping, swimming, climbing, and conservation. First aid, lifesaving,
          and safety programs are synonymous with Scouting. Our programs today
          include strong drug abuse awareness and prevention programs
          emphasizing the value of healthy living habits.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="why">
        <h2>6. Building Character</h2>
        <p>
          Young people need to know to be good and to do good. Few will argue
          with the importance of teaching values and responsibility to our
          children – not only right from wrong, but specific, affirmative values
          such as fairness, courage, honor, and respect for others. Beginning
          with the Scout Oath and Scout Law, the Boy Scouts of America program
          is infused with character-building activities that allow youth to
          apply abstract principles to daily living situations.
